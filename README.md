## Markov Wordgen

The following is a Javascript-implementation of a markov-chain based wordgen, and serves as a follow-up to an older version, which I made with c++. 

The map of weights is included in the javascript file and was generated with a program from the [previous project](https://github.com/Sinitax/Wordmash). If you would like to base your set of weights on a different dictionary, use `chain_gen_json.exe` to generate one.
